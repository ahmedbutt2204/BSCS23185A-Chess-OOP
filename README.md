This project is a fully functional console-based Chess game developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It features a modular structure with separate classes for each chess piece, the board, and players. The game includes legal move validation, turn-based play, and a basic colored UI using the Windows console. With over 128 commits, the project reflects continuous development, debugging, and refinement of core features, emphasizing clean code, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism throughout.
